The `unencrypted/server.{key,crt}` were generated by
`~/pkg/local-cert-generator`, signed by the accompanying `rootCA.{key,pem}`.
The `rootCA.pem` was successfully imported into the Firefox Certificate Manager
and MacOS Keychain.

* Firefox: <about:preferences#privacy> -> `View Certificates` -> `Authorities`
* macOS: `Keychain Access.app` -> `login` -> `Certificates`

You can run a server and client thus:

    $ cargo run -- unencrypted/server.{crt,key} &

    $ curl --cacert ~/pkg/local-cert-generator/unencrypted/rootCA.pem \
        https://localhost:3000

The biggest issue right now is that the private keys are not encrypted at rest,
but Warp does not appear to accept encrypted keys.
